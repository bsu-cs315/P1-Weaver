# Project 1 Iteration 1: Launcher Game
A project by Kc Weaver.

## How To Play
- Click play on the main menu to begin the game.
- Click and drag the circle back and release to launch the projectile at the crates for points.
- Force corresponds to drag distance and you may only launch between zero and ninety degrees.
- You only get three shots, use "r" to reload.
- Press r again to prompt the main menu button

## Project Report

### Reflection
Most of this iteration was spent dealing with warnings and errors. I had trouble renaming most of my files no matter the fix i employed.
Some solutions worked for some files but not for others. This meant that an equal half of the process was working backward from what I'd done so far.
I also encountered issues where code that had worked before stopped working and I couldn't figure out quite why before I fixed it on accident.
I should have spent more time with this iteration, but the most valuable take away I have is the knowledge I've gained.
If I were to start a project from the ground up again, I can think of dozens of ways to save trouble later. 

### Self-Assessment

- [X] D-1: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory on the default branch.
- [X] D-2: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [X] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, in our course organization, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file, no unnecessary files tracked, a single mainline branch named <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>, and all commit messages following <a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit/">our commit message style guide</a>.
- [X] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file, and you have satisfied all license requirements.
- [X] C-4: Either the <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game.
- [X] C-5: The game starts on a title screen. Interacting with the title screen moves the player into the gameplay screen.
- [X] B-1: The project report is complete.
- [X] B-2: Earn one star.
- [X] A-1: Generate neither warnings nor errors at runtime.
- [X] A-2: Earn three stars.
- [X] ⭐ When the game is over, the player can interact to take the game back to the title screen, from which the game can be played again.
- [X] ⭐ Use an <code>AnimationPlayer</code> or <code>Tween</code> to add some pop to the player experience.
- [X] ⭐ The source code complies with <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/best-practices/godot-gdscript/"> the GDScript guidelines</a>.
